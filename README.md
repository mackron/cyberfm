A simple Cyberpunk 2077 archive extractor.

See docs/cyberpunk2077-archive-format.txt for details on the file format.

Thanks to the ZenHAX forums which I only just discovered while searching for
some hints on the compression algorithm. There's a Cyberpunk 2077 post running
over there which will probably eventually cover this stuff in much more detail
by people much smarter and more qualified than me:

    Compression Signatures:      https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=27
    Oodle Function Declarations: https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=7292
    Cyberpunk 2077 Archives:     https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=14565
    
If you're interested in this kind of stuff and haven't heard of ZenHAX, head on
over - there's lots of good stuff there!


Source Code
-----------
Although this project is extremely niche, the code here is written like a
library to hopefully make it useful in case I want to later build a proper
program(s) for working with Cyberpunk 2077 files later on down the track (not
just archives, but also save games, textures, audio, etc.) Let me know if you
have any suggestions or feature requests and I'll consider it.

The code is public domain. I encourage you to do whatever you like with it!
Just make sure you don't go around redistributing any of the extracted assets.
