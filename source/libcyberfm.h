Cyperpunk 2077 uses Oodle for compression. Unfortunately we don't have public access to the official Oodle
headers, but we can write our own version of the necessary function declarations and dynamically load the
APIs from a DLL from another game distribution. This program does *not* include any Oodle stuff - DLLs
need to be sourced from elsewhere.

These function signatures were taken from the ZenHAX forum:
    https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=7292

Also thanks to this forum post regarding compression signatures for the tip about Oodle:
    https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=27

Side note. I discovered the ZenHAX forums while searching around for this compression stuff and found that
their community is also working on this. If you're interested in this stuff, that'll probably be a good
source of information going forward as well.

This is a bit weird. I know that the first item must be the hashed version of the file name. Also, it looks like maybe "file"
is made up of a range of sub-files or something? The 4th and 5th members seem to be an range that correlates with the the
capacity of the list of data specs (the list containing the offsets and sizes of files). I was wondering if maybe this was
intended for things like 3D models, where you have one file for the main model definition, but then other files for materials
that are associated with the model. I'm not entirely sure, but certainly this caused a bit of confusion for me when trying
to figure this one out.

Audio
=====
Audio files seem to be wrapped in a RIFF container, but it's not an actual WAV file. I've seen Opus encoded data as well as non-Opus data. I have
not yet figured out the non-Opus format, but I suspect it's uncompressed PCM data.

The problem is that although it's in a RIFF file, it doesn't actually conform to the WAV spec which means libraries like dr_wav cannot be used to
load the file because a good library won't actually allow those files to pass validation. If it was a valid WAV file, we could use dr_wav to open
the file, and then extract the "data" chunk, which is where the Opus encoded data is located, and then use libopus to decode that data.

What we're doing here is extracting the audio data from the invalid WAV format into a format that is valid. For audio files that use Opus encoding
we're going to extract the Opus audio. For other formats we'll create a valid and playable WAV file.
